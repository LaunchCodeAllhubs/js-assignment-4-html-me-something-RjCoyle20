               <h2>McDonald's - Crew to Crew Trainer</h2>
               <p>
                  My first job was at McDonald's as a high schooler. I made minimum wage, which at the time was $7.25/hr. The job was pretty simple, though fast-paced and tiring on one's feet. The worst part was definitely facing the demeaning attitude of some customers, who I felt were dispectful and condescending. Such is the fast-food life, unfortunately.

               <h2>Graebel Van Lines - Mover</h2>
               <p>
                  I moved furniture in the summer through my last summer of high school and most of those in college. Featuring 60+/hr workweeks in the St.Louis heat, moving furniture was grueling. Here again, customers would often seemingly assume that I must not be very smart to be working as a laborer. Though in this case, the physical toll was likely the most difficult part. On the bright side, the overtime I made during the summers would usually mean that I had saved enough money for the school year.

           <p>
            After a couple years bouncing around local community colleges, I communted to UMSL, where I got my Bachelor's in Philosophy, with minors in French and Psychology. I really loved being a student and found such joy in learning. As one can discern from my fields of study, I was not selecting an academic path based on a track for employment, but studied what I loved instead (je n'allais pas gagner beaucoup d'euros &euro;). I would not say that this is a regret of mine, as I feel I am still getting value out of my education, but due to these choices, I was not in a position to make much money coming out of college.
            I did go back for my Master's in Philosophy, hoping to eventually teach, but I did not find the same passion after returning.

            <h2>Hartford Coffee Company - Barista/Cook</h2>
            <p>
               During my last year in college, I got a job where I loved going to study- Hartford Coffee in Tower Grove South. Overall, this was a great job in a beautiful neighborhood. Good people and amazing coffee. I stayed at Hartford for about 1.5 years before attempting to find a more permanent career.

            <h2>Club Fitness - Certified Personal Trainer</h2>
            <p>
               I then wanted to try a career based on something I was already passionate about- fitness. I got certified as a personal trainer and began working at Club Fitness. There were many benefits to this job, like working in a gym and making meaningful connections with clients. But, odd hours, inconsistent pay, a lack of benefits and then the COVID-19 pandemic made this career path no longer seem right for me.

            <h2>Graybar Electric - Branch Admin/Pricing Specialist</h2>
            <p>
               With the help of a client-turned-friend I worked with at Club Fitness, I was able to get a hybrid-remote office job at a big electrical distribution company. While there are certainly things to complain about here, it is still the best job that I've had overall. I was promoted after a year, and with stock, employee ownership and having a few good connections at the company, especially on the tech side, I can see myself staying at Graybar for a long time. My goal currently is to do coding for them while I TA and give back to LaunchCode, if they'd have me!

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
            This is all not to mention my side-hustle &mdash; walking and sitting dogs for Rover, as well as working at a deli for 6 months and later going back to a different moving company for a time. All of this is not to demonstrate a fear of commitment on my end. The point in going through my somewhat extensive professional history is to demonstrate how difficult it has been for me to find my place in the professional world. This is why LaunchCode respresents so much to me. To finally be on a clear path to securing the comfortable life, while enjoying my job, which I once doubted the possibility of for me and those who rely on me, is the most motivating thing I can think of in getting through this course.
